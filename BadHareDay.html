    <h1>Across the lands of Hasenwelt...</h1>
    <p> from the forests to the seas, the mountains and the cities, one rule reigns supreme, the head Doe or Buck is in charge. Rabbits from all over, from the smallest bunny in the Burrows to the largest hare from New Lagos, aspire to be the one to hold the reigns of the region in their hands, or crush them under their foot. Many stand in the way of each others' goals, but will it be enough to stop the current champion and leader?</p>

    <div class="sm_wrapperr"><h1>Lagomora, reigning queen</h1>
    <p>As true as the sun will set and the moon will rise, another truth known through Hasenwelt is the fact that challenging the queen nowadays would be the same as fighting an army alone. Coming from the lowest burrow, eating bugs to survive, the Queen had struggled day and night to earn her title. Once a proud and kind ruler, one faithful morning, it was as if though a switch was activated in her, causing her to become a monster of her former self. From theories of her making cities wage war on each other for amusement just for her to step in and save them, to rumors shes the reason of upcoming shortages of food and power, her people now follow her out of fear. Now, a tournament has begun in her watch, as all over are attracted to earn promises of power, wealth and status to serve as her right hand rabbit. is this really all that it cracks up to be, or is something else rumbling behind the scenes..?</p>

    <h2>SOTD: Stage of the Day - Magika Forest</h2>
    <p>Legends say that many years ago, before Hasenwelt was how it was today, a powerful wizard had changed the region itself, merging denizens of the unnamed land with the animals of it... at the cost of his life. The land he once occupied, now called Crystalla, is still home to many beings who can attune themselves better to the magic of the land. One such being is Adeline, who like many was attracted to the promises of Hasenwelt's current queen, who wishes to make it to the top and become a master magician, her name known through all of Hasenwelt (and maybe get her plant shop some more recognition on the side.) </p>
